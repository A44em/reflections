How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It made me see what went wrong with the new file that made it malfunction.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It saves time, instead of viewing the whole code you can just see the differences between a working version of the code and the one with the problem.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    I think it saves memory as you choose certain versions to save not all, but it takes time of course.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because docs can be treated separately, unlike code files they can be connected.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	git log
	git diff first_file second_file

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because I know that if I break something I can go back to a version that was working and try again.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I wanna try some AI projects that I have to finish.
