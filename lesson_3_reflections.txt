When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

	When I want others to work with me on the same repository.
	
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because there could be some changes that I don't want to add and others that I do want to add.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

	Forks: For copying someone's repository from their GitHub account to mine.
	Clones: For copying any repository from GitHub into my local machine,
			or from one place in my local machine to another place in the same machine.
	Branches: For making another path for commits in the same repository.
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

	It is good for tracking changes made by other contributors and resolve conflicts.
	
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

	It would be harder as we should share files and wait for changes to be made then continue working.
