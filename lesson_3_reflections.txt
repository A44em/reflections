When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

	When I want others to work with me on the same repository.
	
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because there could be some changes that I don't want to add and others that I do want to add.
