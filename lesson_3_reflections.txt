When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

	When I want others to work with me on the same repository.
	
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because there could be some changes that I don't want to add and others that I do want to add.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

	Forks: For copying someone's repository from their GitHub account to mine.
	Clones: For copying any repository from GitHub into my local machine, or from one place in my local machine to another place in the same machine.
	Branches: For making another path for commits in the same repository.
